# HurlingTracker

A Java + JavaFX app for tracking hurling training records and basic stats, with data saved to CSV files so it persists between runs.

## Features
- Add and view match records (date, teams, score, notes)
- Track basic team/player stats (stored in CSV)
- Simple JavaFX UI for entering and browsing data
- CSV persistence (data is loaded on start and saved automatically)

## Tech Stack
- Java
- JavaFX (GUI)
- CSV files for storage

## Project Structure
- `src/` – Java source code
- `data/` – CSV files used for persistence (created/updated by the app)
- `resources/` – images/icons (if applicable)

### Run (IDE)

2.  Run the main class: `HurlingTrackerFX` (or your main entry class)
